## Abstract

The metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) and growth rate hypothesis (GRH) help explain the mechanistic basis of size (allometry) and temperature dependence on growth rate and whole-body-RNA content in organisms. However, testing the RNA scaling with next-generation sequencing is yet to be done. Here, we validated the assumptions of GRH and MTE on messenger RNA and ribosome abundance using mock community metatranscriptome analysis. Our findings highlight that fast-growing smaller species harbor greater RNA abundance per mass of tissue compared with species having larger body sizes and slower growth rates, where allometric slopes for genomic and gene-level RNA abundance range from –⅓ to –1. We found that genome size and body size impose significant constraints in interspecific RNA abundance scaling, while the assumed temperature dependence appeared to be weak. Lastly, allometric scaling integration in community-level models may extend the use of metatranscriptomics as a reliable tool for estimating ecosystem processes.
